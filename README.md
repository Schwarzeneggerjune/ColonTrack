# Note
This model was built using `mlr3verse` version `0.2.8` and `paradox` version `0.11.1`. Please ensure that the correct versions of these R packages are installed before using the model, as mismatched versions may lead to unforeseen errors.
# ColonTrack
A machine learning model for CRC diagnosis
The model has been trained on extensive clinical ELISA data to achieve high-performance discrimination of colorectal cancer. It shows great potential for early colorectal cancer diagnosis.

The `ColonTrack.rds` file is a machine learning model file built using the R `mlr3` package. The `trails_data.csv` file contains the data used for model training.
```r
# R code example
ColonTrack <- readRDS("path/to/ColonTrack.rds")
trails_data <- read.csv("path/to/trails_data.csv")
predictions <- predict(ColonTrack, newdata = trails_data)
predictions$confusion
```
